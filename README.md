Marmalade Extension for Google Play Billing

This was a fork of the version of the extension present in Marmalade 7.5.1 to add support for the price_amount_micros and price_currency_code fields in the s3eAndroidGooglePlayBillingItemInfo data structure.

Marmalade has now incorporated this fix into 7.6.0p2, and so this repository is no longer necessary.
